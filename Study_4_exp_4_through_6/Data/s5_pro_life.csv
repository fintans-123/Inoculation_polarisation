Abortion is a personal issue, and I believe the right to make decisions about one's own body, including reproductive choices, should remain with the individual. While I understand that there are diverse perspectives on this matter, the core of the issue is bodily autonomy. People should have the right to make medical decisions for themselves without government interference. Access to safe, legal abortion is essential for protecting women's health and ensuring they have control over their lives and futures.

Abortion is such a personal and sensitive topic to talk about, and i think everyone should have the right to make decisions that are best for their own lives and bodies. The legal landscape in the United State has changed a lot recently, especially with different states having varying laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It is a rough and tough divisive issues, but i believe people should have the freedom to choose what ever rights they feel is right for them, within the legal frame work that is constantly  evolving. but to my own personal decision, abortion is a same act of killing an innocence baby. so to my decision and conclusion, killing is wrong and abortion is wrong.
