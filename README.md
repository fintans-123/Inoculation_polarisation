# Inoculation_polarisation
# About

This repository contains data and analysis code for a study that tests the effectiveness of an inoculation intervention in reducing social media engagement with affectively polarised, outgroup derogating content. A rendered R markdown file showing outputs from analyses is included in the 'docs' folder, while the raw markdown code is contained within the 'scripts' folder.
